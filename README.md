# autocomplete

This is a search bar that suggests links based on the user's input.
Built using React and create-react-app.
Uses JSONP to bypass the cross-domain policies in web browsers.
(You are not allowed to make AJAX requests to a web page perceived to be on a different server by the browser.)

Simply clone this repository then install packages via
`yarn` or `npm install`
then
`yarn start` or `npm start`
to start the development server.

You can also run `yarn build` for the production build and deploy with a static server.
